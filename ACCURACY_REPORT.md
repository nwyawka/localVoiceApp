# Speech-to-Text Accuracy Report
## Gettysburg Address Test Results

**Test Date:** October 25, 2025
**Audio File:** gettysburg_address_64kb.mp3
**Model:** Vosk English Large (v0.22, 1.8GB)

---

## Summary

✅ **Overall Accuracy: 78.79%**
- Word Error Rate (WER): 21.21%
- Expected words: 264
- Transcribed words: 271
- Exact word matches: 110 (41.67%)
- Levenshtein distance: 56

---

## Error Analysis

### 1. Punctuation Removal (Expected)
- **Impact:** All commas, periods, hyphens removed
- **Reason:** Vosk without punctuation model
- **Examples:**
  - "continent," → "continent"
  - "liberty," → "liberty"
  - "battle-field" → "battlefield"

### 2. Word Duplications (3 instances)
- **Impact:** Minor (3 words out of 271)
- **Errors found:**
  - "add add or detract" (should be "add or detract")
  - "last last full measure" (should be "last full measure")
  - "for from the earth" (should be "from the earth")
- **Fix:** Added consecutive duplicate filtering in app

### 3. Substitution Errors (2 instances)
- "that" → "at" (homophone confusion)
- "thus far" → "thus so far" (word insertion)

### 4. Word Splitting/Merging
- "can not" vs "cannot" (both valid, affects word count)
- "battle-field" vs "battlefield" (hyphen handling)

---

## Optimizations Implemented

### ✅ 1. Enhanced Word Deduplication
**Before:** Words could be typed multiple times during long recordings
**After:** Strict validation ensures each word typed only once
```javascript
// Verify beginning matches before typing new words
for (let i = 0; i < alreadyTypedCount; i++) {
    if (newWords[i] !== typedWords[i]) {
        wordsMatch = false;
        break;
    }
}
```

### ✅ 2. Consecutive Duplicate Filtering
**Before:** "add add", "last last", "for from" duplicates
**After:** Skip consecutive identical words
```javascript
// Skip if this word is a duplicate of the last typed word
if (typedWords.length > 0 && word === typedWords[typedWords.length - 1]) {
    continue;
}
```

### ✅ 3. Buffer Overflow Fix
**Before:** Crash during recording (offset out of range)
**After:** Correct loop increment for Int16 audio data
```javascript
// Loop through buffer in 2-byte increments (Int16 = 2 bytes)
for (let i = 0; i < buffer.length; i += 2) {
    const normalized = buffer.readInt16LE(i) / 32768.0;
```

### ✅ 4. Error Logging
**Before:** Crashes hidden by blessed fullscreen
**After:** Errors logged to `/tmp/voice-app-error.log`

2. **Language Model Tuning** - Fine-tune for specific use cases
3. **Multi-speaker Support** - Improve accuracy for different voices

### Low Priority
1. **Real-time Punctuation** - Add live punctuation prediction
2. **Word Alternatives** - Show confidence scores/alternatives
3. **Accent Adaptation** - Train on user's voice

## Testing Methodology

1. **Convert MP3 to WAV:** `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav`
2. **Process with Vosk:** Large English model (v0.22)
3. **Calculate WER:** Levenshtein distance algorithm
4. **Compare Output:** Word-by-word diff against expected text

Test script: `test-accuracy.js` (included in repository)
