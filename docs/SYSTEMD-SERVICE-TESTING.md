# Systemd Service Testing - Audio Interface Redesign

## Status: NOT TESTED IN WORKTREE

The systemd service integration was **not tested** during the automated test phase for the following reasons:

1. **Service Location:** The existing voice-to-text.service points to `/home/mattuh/Desktop/DataWerkes/localVoiceApp/index.js` (main repo)
2. **Worktree Isolation:** Testing is being done in worktree at `.worktrees/audio-interface-redesign/index.js`
3. **Risk of Disruption:** Modifying the service would affect the production version running in the main directory

## Current Service Status

```
Service: voice-to-text.service
Status: inactive (dead) since 2025-10-20
Location: /home/mattuh/.config/systemd/user/voice-to-text.service
Points to: /home/mattuh/Desktop/DataWerkes/localVoiceApp/index.js
```

## Why Service Should Work

The redesigned interface is **fully compatible** with systemd service for the following reasons:

1. **No Service File Changes:** The service configuration remains unchanged
2. **Same Dependencies:** All system dependencies (xdotool, SoX, pactl) are unchanged
3. **Same Entry Point:** index.js is the same entry point
4. **Same Node Modules:** All required npm packages are unchanged
5. **No Environment Changes:** DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY requirements are unchanged
6. **Same Keyboard Listener:** F9 global hotkey still uses node-global-key-listener
7. **Same Vosk Model:** Speech recognition model and logic unchanged
8. **Same xdotool Typing:** Text typing mechanism unchanged

## What Changed (All UI-Only)

The changes are **purely visual** and do not affect service integration:

- Blessed box layout (internal to application)
- Status display formatting
- Info line structure
- Waveform colors
- Audio level display (new feature, but doesn't affect service)
- Microphone detection (runs in-process, no system changes)

## Testing Plan for User

When ready to test with systemd service, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Test in Worktree First (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/mattuh/Desktop/DataWerkes/localVoiceApp/.worktrees/audio-interface-redesign

# Stop existing service
systemctl --user stop voice-to-text

# Test directly
./launch.sh
# Or: npm start

# If successful, proceed to Option 2
```

### Option 2: Update Main Repo and Service
```bash
# After merging to master or satisfied with testing
cd /home/mattuh/Desktop/DataWerkes/localVoiceApp

# Pull changes from worktree or merge branch
cp .worktrees/audio-interface-redesign/index.js .

# Restart service
systemctl --user restart voice-to-text

# Check status
systemctl --user status voice-to-text

# Watch logs
journalctl --user -u voice-to-text -f
```

### Option 3: Temporary Service for Worktree
```bash
# Create temporary service file pointing to worktree
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/voice-to-text-test.service << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Local Voice-to-Text Service (Test)
After=graphical.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/mattuh/Desktop/DataWerkes/localVoiceApp/.worktrees/audio-interface-redesign
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
Environment="DISPLAY=:0"
Environment="XAUTHORITY=/home/mattuh/.Xauthority"

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF

# Reload systemd
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# Start test service
systemctl --user start voice-to-text-test

# Check status
systemctl --user status voice-to-text-test

# When done testing, remove
systemctl --user stop voice-to-text-test
systemctl --user disable voice-to-text-test
rm ~/.config/systemd/user/voice-to-text-test.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

## Expected Service Behavior

When service is running with the new interface:

1. **No Visual Terminal:** Service runs in background (no blessed UI visible)
2. **F9 Still Works:** Global keyboard listener still captures F9
3. **Status Not Visible:** Since blessed screen not visible, status only internal
4. **Typing Still Works:** xdotool still types at cursor position
5. **Logging:** journalctl will show startup messages and any errors

**Note:** The blessed terminal UI is primarily for direct execution (npm start or ./launch.sh). When running as a service, the UI exists but is not displayed. The core functionality (F9, recording, transcription, typing) works identically.

## Verification Checklist

After deploying to service:

- [ ] Service starts without errors: `systemctl --user status voice-to-text`
- [ ] No errors in logs: `journalctl --user -u voice-to-text -n 50`
- [ ] F9 key triggers recording (speak and check text appears)
- [ ] Text typed at cursor position
- [ ] Audio recorded successfully
- [ ] Vosk model loads (check logs)
- [ ] Service auto-restarts on failure (RestartSec=5)
- [ ] Service starts on login (if enabled)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur with service:

```bash
# Stop new version
systemctl --user stop voice-to-text

# Restore previous index.js from git
cd /home/mattuh/Desktop/DataWerkes/localVoiceApp
git checkout HEAD~1 index.js  # or specific commit before redesign

# Restart service
systemctl --user restart voice-to-text

# Verify old version works
systemctl --user status voice-to-text
```

## Conclusion

**Service testing was intentionally skipped** during worktree development to maintain stability of the production installation. The changes are UI-only and fully compatible with systemd service operation. User should test service integration after:

1. Manual testing in worktree is successful
2. All visual features verified
3. Transcription accuracy confirmed
4. Ready to deploy to production

**Document created:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** Service testing deferred to post-merge phase
**Risk assessment:** LOW (UI-only changes, no service configuration changes)
